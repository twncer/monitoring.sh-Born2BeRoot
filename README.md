[TÜRKÇE]

Here is a simplified "monitoring.sh" file for your Born2BeRoot project.

File is written in Turkish but **you can easily translate it by variable names**.

Don't forget the translate *"Aktif => Active, Aktif değil => Deactive"* at ```is_lvm_active``` 

If your partitions are not according to BONUS part, you'll have to make some arrangements.
